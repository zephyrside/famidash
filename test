explain nation
--------------

ahoy hoy
zephyrside here
after the 4 months of silence i think i owe yall an explanation of... whatever happened

the greentext version is as follows:

> be usersniper
> weegeepie drama going on for 5 years by that point (turns out he was a pedophile the whole time)
> i wanted a fresh start
> leaves the internet
> rejoins as zephyrside
> i make a whole backstory so that nobody from the wgp community suspects a thing
> i begin to question my gender identity
> trans gaming
> kando liked nesgd and wanted to assist
> server gets set up
> things are pretty good for the most part
> december 31 2023 happens
> turns out my mother didn't like the trans thing (or kando) (or jaezu)
> the taketh away of the laeptop occurs

basically, drama from another community spilled over to my personal life and brought my internet funny man (or woman, in this case) shenanigans to a screeching halt

the new identity was also partially an excuse to explore my feminine side a bit
also yeah i'm not trans, unfortunately. did some thinking and decided its not what i want.


due to the events that occurred, i can't communicate with kando directly anymore since i'm risking my whole career
oh well, i guess emancipation is an option /shrug


as for famidash? i can't thank yall enough for keeping it alive. the fact that i left an impact on the community as a whole is absolutely insane
i might hop on my old github account and work on the new repo at some point within the next month







to jaezu:
sorry you got caught in the crossfire. i hope we can remain internet friends after what went down

to zenith:
you're probably one of the coolest people i've ever met online. hope we can still meet up irl in the future

to kando:
i owe you one
